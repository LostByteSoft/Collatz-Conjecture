27 specail number

9663 special number

68719476736 divisible dy 16

Collatz part of the solution ! This is not a proof !
  	
There are no number to go infinite because when you fell on 1024 multiple
you go directly to 1 (1024/2=512/2=256/2=128/2=64/2=32/2=16/2=8/2=4/2=2/2=1).
They're all divide by 2.

There are INFINITE multiples of 16 (1024) so you always return to 1 directly.
There are INFINITE multiples of 2 so you always return to 1 eventually.
And multiply *3+1 you have 17 % chance to get an odd number.
	
You have always 50 % chance to get an odd number divisible by 2 and each time
you divide by 2 and going to a loop where you get a divisible by 16 to go to 1.
	
Each time you *3+1 you have 9 % chance this number is a multiple 2-4-8-16...
16384-32768 ... etc and going to a loop where you get a divisible by 16 to go to 1.

Even very large prime numbers will end up with a multipole of 16 eventually.
	
You have more chance to win in a casino ...

There are NO solution at Collatz.

And no proof either...
 
Exemple 1: 16.

Exemple 2: 68719476736 * 2 = 137438953472 (multiple of 2,4 ,8, 16...etc).
